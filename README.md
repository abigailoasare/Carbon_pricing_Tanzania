  - This repository contains codes and supplementary data on "Incidence of Carbon Pricing in Tanzania:
    Using Revenues to Empower Low-Income Households with Renewable Energy" by Asare and Sch√ºrer

## Data_files folder:
  - GTAP_matching_categories.xlsx contains matching of item codes to the consumption categories (food, goods, energy, services).
  - GTAP_matching_sectors.xlsx contains matching each item code to GTAP sectors.
  - hh-CO2-emmisions*.xlsx and hh-CO2-intensities*.xlsx contains carbon intensities and CO_2 emissions.
  - Where int corresponds to the international; TZA to the national; ELY to the electricity and fuel to the fuel carbon price. 
 **Note:** _Due to confidentiality, we can not make available the micro and GTAP raw data_.
